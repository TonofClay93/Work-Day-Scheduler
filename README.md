# Work-Day-Scheduler

What we have here is the work day scheduler for module 5 of UCF boot camp.

What you can utilize this project for is your day to day (9am-5pm) schedule to help keep track of when things must be done. Also tends to be the best thing to help stay on track for school work.

Below you can find screenshots of the application in process.
